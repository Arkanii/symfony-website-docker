# The Caddyfile is an easy way to configure your Caddy web server.
#
# Unless the file starts with a global options block, the first
# uncommented line is always the address of your site.
#
# To use your own domain name (with automatic HTTPS), first make
# sure your domain's A/AAAA DNS records are properly pointed to
# this machine's public IP, then replace the line below with your
# domain name.

{$HOST}:{$PORT_SYMFONY} {
    # Enable access logging (to the console)
    log

    # Set this path to your site's directory.
    root * /srv/public

    # Encodes responses using Gzip compression
    encode gzip

    # Use Caddy's internal, locally-trusted CA to produce certificates for this site.
    tls internal

    # Push content to the client using HTTP/2 server push
    push

    # Enable the static file server.
    file_server

    # Another common task is to set up a reverse proxy:
    # reverse_proxy localhost:8080

    # Or serve a PHP site through php-fpm:
    php_fastcgi php-fpm:9000
